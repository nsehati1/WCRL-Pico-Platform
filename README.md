# WCRL-Pico-Platform
Software for the newly designed Raspberry Pi Pico hardware platform


This code is to be integrated with the newly designed and work-in-progress WCRL Raspberry Pi Pico hardware platform. This platform integrates a Raspberry Pi Pico W, dc motors, stepper motor drivers, an ESC, and a BLDC motor for the battle bot. A separate ESP8266 module (coded in C) generates a soft access network for the Pico to connect to. The python code defines functions for motor and ESC movement, creates a network connection between the Pico and the ESP, and generates a UI at the Pico's generate IP address for robot control.


This code is a work in progress and will be updated as improvements are made.
